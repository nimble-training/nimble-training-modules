# nimble-training-modules
Modules for use in preparing workshops and other trainings.

These modules are meant as a starting point for preparing materials for a specific workshop. They are largely built off of Chris Paciorek's 2018 BYU workshop, with ecological material from Perry de Valpine's 2018 Vogelwarte workshop.
